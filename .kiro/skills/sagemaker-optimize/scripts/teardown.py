"""Delete an endpoint and everything attached to it. Endpoints bill while InService.

Run this the moment you are done. SageMaker keeps a real GPU instance running for a
real-time endpoint, so the cost clock runs until you delete it. We tear down in the
reverse order of creation:

    InferenceComponent  ->  Endpoint  ->  EndpointConfig  ->  Model

Each delete is best-effort: if a resource is already gone we keep going, so this is
safe to run twice.

Usage:
    python scripts/teardown.py --endpoint NAME                     # dry run: list what would go
    python scripts/teardown.py --endpoint NAME --yes               # actually delete
